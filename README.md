### HEY THIS IS SEJAL âœ¨

- ðŸ§  A Computer Science student
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter and how to connect ideas to real-world code.
- ðŸ’— Sometimes I just build for myself â€” to remember people, moments, or emotions.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learn best when Iâ€™m building something personal â€” even if it never ships.
